# Cplusplus_AlgorithmStudy
A library of C++ algorithms that I have studied & solutions for question in lougu (https://www.luogu.com.cn/)

Including codes for simulation of different situation of the questions, and some pure math questions.

### Simple and most common algorithms include:
1.**Game Theory**
  Refers to the study of the strategies of relevant parties in a game between multiple individuals or teams under specific conditions, and the implementation of corresponding strategies.
  
2.**Recursion**
  Refers to a function that calls itsef until certain condition is meet

3.**Sorting**
  (This isn't finish)
  Include different sorting methods like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Counting Sort

4.**Greedy**
  Algorithms that solves the problem by always choosing the best and most optimal option at the moment
  
5.**Binary Search**
  Binary search is an algorithm that sorts arrays by repeatedly dividing the interval in half

### Advance algorithms include:
1.**Dynamic Programming(DP)**
  Computer programming technique where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, the results are saved, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution-spicework
  
2.**Advance Search(DFS&BFS)**
  -DFS (Depth-first Search): Algorithms that search in depth in one path and step back to the last branch if the result is incorrect
  -BFS (Breadth-first Search): Algorithms that note each posible
3.**High Precision**

4.**Binary Tree**

### Advance++ algorithms include:
This part is very hard for me and I still did not understand fully so I will not try to explain it (This part are algorithms that I am learning)

1.**Lowest Common Ancestor**
2.**Graph Theory**
