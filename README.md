# Cplusplus_AlgorithmStudy
A library of C++ algorithms that I have studied & solutions for question in lougu (https://www.luogu.com.cn/)

Including codes for simulation of different situation of the questions, and some pure math questions.

#### Simple and most common algorithms include:
1.**Game Theory**
  Refers to the study of the strategies of relevant parties in a game between multiple individuals or teams under specific conditions, and the implementation of corresponding strategies.
  
2.**Recursion**


3.**Recursion**

4.**Sorting**
