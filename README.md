# Cplusplus_AlgorithmStudy
A library of C++ algorithms that I have studied & solutions for question in lougu (https://www.luogu.com.cn/)

Including codes for simulation of different situation of the questions, and some pure math questions.

### Simple and most common algorithms include:
1.**Game Theory**
  Refers to the study of the strategies of relevant parties in a game between multiple individuals or teams under specific conditions, and the implementation of corresponding strategies.
  
2.**Recursion**
  Refers to a function that calls itsef until certain condition is meet

3.**Sorting**

4.**Greedy**

5.**Binary**

### Advance algorithms include:
1.**Dynamic Programming(DP)**
  
2.**Advance Search(DFS&BFS)**

3.**High Precision**

4.**Binary Tree**

### Advance++ algorithms include:
1.**Lowest Common Ancestor**

2.**Graph Theory**
